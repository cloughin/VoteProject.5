    <p>In 2003, the founder of this project went to the polls to 
    vote for the Virginia State Senate and State House offices.  He found 
    that he didn’t have the slightest idea who any of the candidates were, 
    or anything about their positions and views, or any knowledge about the 
    ballot measures. Some candidate names, found on the clutter of street and 
    lawn posters, seemed familiar. He questioned the value of voting if voters 
    knew nothing about what they were voting for. This seemed like a major 
    flaw in our representative democracy.</p>

    <p>Most American citizens are also aware that there are other significant 
    problems with our representative democracy. Money and special interest 
    groups have too much influence in elections and government. Political 
    advertising is often deceptive and misleading. There is little or no 
    media coverage of county and local elections. Voter turnout is low. 
    To help address these problems the Vote-USA project was launched.</p>

    <p>The project’s goal was to provide a better way. Using the Internet, 
    he felt that he could provide voters with information they needed to 
    vote on a more informed basis and to provide candidates with the means 
    to easily communicate with voters, free of charge. By the time of the 
    2004 General Election, Vote-USA.org was able to provide a customized 
    sample ballot for any address in the country that allowed voters to 
    compare the candidates’ bios, pictures, and, most importantly, their 
    positions and views on the issues in an easy side-by-side format.</p>

    <p>Since 2004, Vote-USA.org has covered all general elections in all 
    states and most off-year, special and primary elections. We have 
    provided voters with over 20 million candidate comparison pages.</p> 

    <p>Operations are funded exclusively through contributions from private 
    citizens and all contributions are 100% tax-deductible. To date, the 
    level of donations has limited the depth of information which we can 
    provide and the number of local elections which we can cover. We would 
    be grateful for your support in helping us truly make American government 
    “of the people, by the people, and for the people.”</p>
