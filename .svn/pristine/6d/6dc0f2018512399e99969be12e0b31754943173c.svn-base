-->
  <p>
    These help instructions are for volunteers to perform valuable tasks:</p>
  <p class="H">
    Scraping candidate websites for pictures, biographical information and views on 
    the issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    The objective of scraping candidates&#39; website is to obtain as much accurate 
    information possible about the candidates to help voters make informed choices. 
    The information you obtain will be presented in a side-by-side manner for 
    voters. Scraping a website can be done for any candidate or elected official. 
    Normally however, the websites of candidates in an upcoming election are 
    scrapped and the instructions below explain how that is done.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p class="H">
    Navigate to the specific election</p>
  <p>
    You need to navigate to the form that manages the specific election whose 
    candidates&#39; websites you intend to scrape.</p>
  <p>

  <hr />
  <p class="H">
    The Election Management Report</p>
  <p>
    At the bottom of the form presented is the Election Management Section with a 
    report of all the candidates in the various election contests. The links on this 
    report will present various forms to perform all the functions to manage the 
    election, including the loading of the candidate information and pictures.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style5" src="../Volunteers/ElectionManagement.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p>
    The Office Contest link presents a form where candidates can be added or deleted 
    in the particular office contest.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style6" src="../Volunteers/OfficeContestLink.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p>
    The Candidate Name link presents a form where information given to us from the 
    state election authority about the candidate can be entered.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style7" src="../Volunteers/CandidateNameLink.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p>
    The Website and social media links present the website and social media pages of 
    the candidate.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style8" src="../Volunteers/WebsiteSocialMediaLinks.png" 
      border="1" /></p>
  <p class="HSmall">
    NONE OF THESE LINKS ARE USED TO SCRAPE CANDIDATE WEBSITES.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each candidate a headshot photo or a No Photo image is shown. These are 
    image links that will present the exact form 
    that particular candidate uses to enter his or her biographical information, 
    social media links, picture, positions and views. The data entered using this 
    form is the information we present on the candidates’ Introduction Pages. 
    Clicking on a 
    photo/no photo image link will give you the same capabilities as the candidate 
    to enter his or her information.
  </p>
  <p class="HSmall">
    This is the link you use to present the candidate&#39;s introduction information 
    form and where you begin in the scrapping process.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style9" src="../Volunteers/PictureLink.png" border="1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img class="style10" src="../Volunteers/NoPhotoLink.png" border="1" /></p>
  <hr />
  <p align="left" class="H">
    Candidate Introduction Form</p>
  <p align="left">
    Clicking on the candidate photo or No Photo image on the Election Management 
    Report will present the Candidate Introduction Form. The information entered on 
    this form is shown to voters on the candidate&#39;s introduction page and on other 
    pages where the candidates are compared side-by-side.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="HSmall">
    Candidate&#39;s Website Address</p>
  <p align="left">
    In order to obtain information about a candidate you need to find the 
    candidate&#39;s website.</p>
  <p align="left">
    * Copy the candidate&#39;s name found at the top of the form.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="1" class="style19" src="../Volunteers/CandidateName.png" /></p>
  <p align="left">
    * Launch a seperate browser. Paste the name in a searh textbox and do a search 
    on the name.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style15" src="../Volunteers/GoogleSearch.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p>
    If the candidate has a website, you should be able to find it on the first page 
    of the search results. Click on the link if you have any doubts regarding 
    whether link is the official website to confirm its authenticity. If the 
    candidate does not have a website look for a Facebook link. Some candidates use 
    Facebook for an Internet presence when they don&#39;t have a website. If nothing can 
    be found then you should skip this candiate and go back the the Election 
    Managemet Report and proceed to the next candidate.</p>
  <p>
    * If the candidate&#39;s website is found, copy and paste the address into the 
    textbox provided and select Enter. A quik way to copy the address is to right 
    click on the link or image, selecting &quot;Copy Shortcut&quot; in an IE browser or &quot;Copy 
    Link Location&quot; in Firefox browser.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style14" src="../Volunteers/CampaignWebsite.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p>
    When you select Enter to record the website address, the textbox title becomes a 
    link. Clicking this link will present the candidate&#39;s website. This can be 
    helpful to obtain and scrape additional information.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="1" class="style20" src="../Volunteers/CandidateWebsiteLink.png" /></p>
  <p>
    Once you have obtained the candidate&#39;s website, use it to capture other 
    information for this form. The sections on the form will be covered in the order 
    they appear, which is not necessarily order of importance.</p>
  <p class="HSmall">
    Name on Ballots</p>
  <p align="left">
    Do not enter or change any of the textboxes in the Name on Ballots Section 
    because this is the name provided by the election authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="style11" src="../Volunteers/NameSection.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p class="HSmall">
    Political Party</p>
  <p>
    *
    Use the party drop-down list if the political party needs to be selected or changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="style12" src="../Volunteers/PartySection.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p class="HSmall">
    Date of Birth</p>
  <p>
    Enter the date of birth if that is available. The age is automatically computed 
    when you select the Enter key.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style13" src="../Volunteers/DateOfBirthSection.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p class="HSmall">
    Social Media Link Addresses</p>
  <p>
    The six social media links are very important to obtain because they provide 
    valuable additional information about the candidate. They are the Internet 
    addresses for the social media icons and are presented on all pages where the 
    candidate appears.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="1" class="style21" src="../Volunteers/SocialMediaIcons.png" /></p>
  <p>
    * Search on the candidate name plus the social media name, like Facebook, 
    Wikipedia, YouTube, Flickr, Twitter and RSS. This will usually provide the 
    appropriate Internet address.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style16" src="../Volunteers/GoogleFacebookSearch.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p>
    * Copy and paste the address in the appropriate textbox and select the Enter key 
    for any or the addresses that your may find. A quik way to copy the address is 
    to right click on the link or image, selecting &quot;Copy Shortcut&quot; in an IE browser 
    or &quot;Copy Link Location&quot; in Firefox browser.</p>
  <p>
    <img class="style17" src="../Volunteers/SocialMediaSection.png" /></p>
  <p>
    Often the social media links can be easily found on the candidate’s website.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img class="style18" src="../Volunteers/SocialMediaLinks.png" border="1" /></p>
  <p class="HSmall">
    Contact Information</p>
  <p>
    Contact information is not very important because it is usually provided by the 
    state election authority and usually takes some searching on the candidate&#39;s 
    website to find. If it is easily obtained copy and paste the information in the 
    textboxes provided.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="1" class="style22" src="../Volunteers/ContactInformation.png" /></p>
  <p class="HSmall">
    Candidate&#39;s Picture</p>
  <p>
    The candidate&#39;s picture is very important and is shown on all pages where the 
    candidate appars. The picture you upload will be automatically resized to fit on 
    the candidate&#39;s Introduction Page. The best type of picture would be a profile 
    type picture that a photographer might take. We also automatically crop the 
    picture you upload for a headshot picture which are then used on ballots and 
    reports. </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;The picture should be the best current picture you can find of the 
    candidate. Usually the best pictures are found on the candidate&#39;s facebook 
    pages. All too often the candidate&#39;s website contains a picture when the 
    candidate was much younger. We want to provide voters with the most accurate 
    candidate pictures.</p>
  <p>
    * When you find the best picture, save it on your PC. Normally you can simply 
    right click on the image and select save picture as...</p>
  <p>
    If this does not work you may need to use an image capture tool. And if you do 
    not have such a tool skip capturing the candidate&#39;s picture.</p>
  <p>
    * When you have saved the candidate&#39;s picture on your PC, follow the 
    instructions on the form to upload the picture.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="1" class="style23" src="../Volunteers/YourPicture.png" /></p>
  <p class="HSmall">
    Biographical Information</p>
  <p>
    Nine textboxes are provide to obtain various biographical information about the 
    candidate. On most candidate websites you will find a button, tab or link to a 
    page about or biogaphy of the candidate.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="1" class="style24" src="../Volunteers/AboutLink.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img border="1" class="style25" src="../Volunteers/AboutTab.png" /></p>
  <p>
    * Go to the page and copy and paste the specific information in the appropriate 
    textbox. </p>
