            We welcome the opportunity to partner with any organizations that can help fulfill
            our goal of providing voters with as much useful information as possible. Some possibilities
            are:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Non-Partisan Politically Engaged Organizations</b><br />
            We welcome the opportunity to cooperate with and support 
            non-partisan organizations that provide valuable electoral and political information. 
            We help to increase public awareness of these organizations by providing links to their websites. 
            We can also provide them with tools to communicate their special information, 
            like voting records and political contributions, to the public.
          </p>

          <p>Currently we are partnering with the following non-partisan organizations.</p>

          <p>
          <a class="partner ivn" href="http://www.endpartisanship.com/" title="End Partisanship" target="_blank">
          The Independent Voter Network (IVN) is an online news platform for 
          independent-minded voters, public officials, civic leaders, and 
          journalists. It provides political analysis and commentary in an 
          effort to elevate the level of our public discourse.</a>
          </p>

          <p>
          <a class="partner endpartisanship" href="http://ivn.us/" title="Independent Voter Network" target="_blank">
          End Partisanship is a coalition of non-partisan organizations advocating for an end to 
          party control of elections. They believe that representatives should represent people,
          not parties and are challenging partisan primaries in the courtroom.</a>
          </p>

          <p>
          <a class="partner nolabels" href="http://nolabels.org/" target="_blank">
          No Labels supports reforms, leaders and legislation
            that will help fix America’s broken government and break the stranglehold that the
            extremes currently have on our political process. </a>
          </p>

          <p>
          <a class="partner recovering" href="http://therecoveringpolitician.com" target="_blank">
          The Recovering Politician is a post-partisan forum 
          featuring officials who’ve left the area and lived to write about it. </a>
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Foundations</b><br />
            We have applied to a number of foundations whose initiatives seem to fit with our
            objectives. Although to date we have not received any such funding assistance, we
            would be grateful for the opportunity to work with foundations whose mission it
            is to strengthen our representative democracy.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Media and News Outlets</b><br />
            We have given newspapers and other media permission to use our pictures and candidate
            information in their coverage of elections.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Political Parties</b><br />
            We have provided a number of state political parties with the ability to provide
            information and pictures of their candidates.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Politically Engaged Organizations</b><br />
            We can provide politically engaged organizations with pre-checked sample ballots
            that highlight endorsed candidates. These customized ballot pages can then be integrated
            into that organization’s website.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Support from For-Profit Businesses</b><br />
            For-profit businesses can support us by donating goods and services. These contributions
            are considered “in-kind” donations and are tax deductible. We would be grateful
            for other in-kind donations including data entry, hosting, technical consulting,
            and assistance with social networking and search engine issues. </p>
            
            <p>These are the businesses
            that have been a great help and support to us to date:
