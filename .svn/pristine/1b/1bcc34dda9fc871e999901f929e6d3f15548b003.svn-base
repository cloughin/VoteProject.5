          <p>In 2003, the founder of this project went to the polls to 
          vote for the Virginia State Senate and State House offices.  He found 
          that he didn’t have the slightest idea who any of the candidates were, 
          or anything about their positions and views, or any knowledge about the 
          ballot measures. Some candidate names, found on the clutter of street and 
          lawn posters, seemed familiar. He questioned the value of voting if voters 
          knew nothing about what they were voting for. This seemed like a major 
          flaw in our representative democracy.</p>

          <p>Most American citizens are also aware that there are other significant 
          problems with our representative democracy. Money and special interest 
          groups have too much influence in elections and government. Political 
          advertising is often deceptive and misleading. There is little or no 
          media coverage of county and local elections. Voter turnout is low. 
          To help address these problems the Vote-USA project was launched.</p>

          <p>The project’s goal was to provide a better way. Using the Internet, 
          he felt that he could provide voters with information they needed to 
          vote on a more informed basis and to provide candidates with the means 
          to easily communicate with voters, free of charge. By the time of the 
          2004 General Election, Vote-USA.org was able to provide a customized 
          sample ballot for any address in the country that allowed voters to 
          compare the candidates’ bios, pictures, and, most importantly, their 
          positions and views on the issues in an easy side-by-side format.</p>

          <p>Since 2004, Vote-USA.org has covered all general elections in all 
          states and most off-year, special and primary elections. We have 
          provided voters with over 20 million candidate comparison pages.</p> 

          <p>Operations are funded exclusively through contributions from private 
          citizens and all contributions are 100% tax-deductible. To date, the 
          level of donations has limited the depth of information which we can 
          provide and the number of local elections which we can cover. We would 
          be grateful for your support in helping us truly make American government 
          “of the people, by the people, and for the people.”</p>
