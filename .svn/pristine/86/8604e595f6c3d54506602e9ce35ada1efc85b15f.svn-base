        <h2>Election Authority Tools</h2>

          <p>Most of the 51 state election authorities have been very cooperative in 
          response to our requests for election rosters. Since 2004, Vote-USA has 
          used these rosters to cover all general elections, most off-year elections, 
          and many primary elections.</p>

          <p>All states, counties, and many local districts have their own rules 
          and regulations regarding elections. Some states are responsible 
          for federal, state, county and local elected offices, while other 
          states delegate this responsibility to the counties and local districts. 
          Each authority has its own ballot access requirements, set of elected 
          offices, election rosters, and election calendars. Although we have not yet
          begun to work with county and local district election authorities, we 
          intend to do so in the near future, finances permitting.</p>

          <p>Vote-USA has the tools to allow any state election authority to enter 
          and edit its own election rosters for the Vote-USA platform. 
          Doing so makes our customized sample ballots available at the earliest 
          possible time, guarantees their accuracy, and reduces our data entry load. 
          We also have the tools to add our customized sample ballots and other 
          reporting capabilities to any state election website. We welcome the 
          opportunity to work with any state that desires to utilize these 
          capabilities.</p>
