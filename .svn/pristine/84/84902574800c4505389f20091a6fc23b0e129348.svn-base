    <p>The Vote-USA project relies heavily on the efforts of volunteers.  
    To get involved, all you need is an internet connection and the desire. 
    Here are some of ways you can contribute.</p>

    <div class="sub">

      <h4>Scrape candidate websites for pictures, biographical 
      information and views on the issues.</h4>

      <p>When we have incomplete or outdated information for candidates, 
      we need volunteers to locate and copy the correct information from 
      the candidates’ campaign websites into our platform.</p>

      <h4>Enter state election rosters for upcoming elections.</h4>

      <p>Each state provides us with its election roster prior to each 
      election. These rosters must be loaded into our platform as quickly 
      as possible so that we can provide timely information to the voters.</p>

      <h4>Identify county and local offices.</h4>

      <p>We are currently in the process of expanding our platform to include 
      county and local contests and ballot measures. We need volunteers to 
      research each state’s county and local districts to identify and enter
      the county and local elected offices.</p>

      <h4>Interview the candidates.</h4>

      <p>We need volunteers willing to go into the field to meet and 
      interview the candidates, and to record videos of the candidates 
      expressing their views on issues of their choice. These videos will 
      be posted to YouTube and linked to from within our site.</p>

      <h4>Become an Intern or State Administrator.</h4>

      <p>Volunteers who makes significant contributions will be given the 
      title of Intern and provided with a Vote-USA.org email account and 
      business cards.</p>

      <p>We need a State Administrator for each of the 50 States and DC. 
      We hope to recruit these people from our pool of volunteers who are 
      willing to make a larger commitment to the project.</p>
