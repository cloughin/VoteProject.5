  <strong>Googled: Republicans Double Democrats; Paul Doubles Huckabee; Obama Beats
      Clinton by a Third<br />
    <br />
  </strong>For the five days between December 7th and 11th, almost a half million
  searches were performed on one of the 16 Republican or Democratic candidate names
  using Google. The total number of searches performed on any of the Republican candidate
  names was almost double that of any of the Democratic candidate names-- 65% vs.
  35%, respectively<br />
  <br />
  People searching on Republican Ron Paul almost doubled that of Mike Huckabee --
  45% vs. 23%, respectively. While, Mike Huckabee had almost double the searches on
  his name than on either Mitt Romney (12%) or Rudy Giuliani (10%). The other four
  Republican candidate names were each searched on less than 5%.
  <br />
  <br />
  The differences between searches done on the Democratic candidate names were not
  nearly as dramatic. Barack Obama had about a third more searches done on his name
  than on Hillary Clinton, with Obama getting 44% to Clinton’s 28%. John Edwards can
  claim a solid third place on his name with 11%. Kucinich, Biden and Richardson had
  between 6% and 4% on their names.
  <br />
  <br />
  These numbers are very interesting, but what do they mean? Probably every statistician
  would come up with a different analysis. Is there more interest in the Republican
  candidates than the Democratic candidates or are Republicans just more Internet
  literate? Is Ron Paul and Barack Obama more of interest or just less well known
  than Mike Huckabee and Hillary Clinton? To learn more, use these links for:<br />

  To acquire these statistics, Vote-USA.org ran 16 Google AdWord ads, one for
  each or the 16 Presidential Primary Candidates. The ads were worded exactly the
  same, except for the candidate’s name. And, each ad used only the single candidate
  name as the complete keyword search list. Consequently, any time a search was performed
  on one of the candidate’s names, an ad would be served. To obtain the number of
  ‘Names Googled’ in our statistics and graphs, we used the number of times each candidate’s
  ad was served. These are called impressions. The ads ran all day for five days.
